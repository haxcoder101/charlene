            Since we connect in Facebook on Febuary 14th, 2025,
            It‚Äôs incredible to think how just a few days ago, I didn‚Äôt even know
            who you were. Meeting you through Facebook was a chance I‚Äôm
            forever grateful for. In the beginning, I wasn‚Äôt sure how we would
            connect, how we‚Äôd talk, or how you‚Äôd be. But now, after just a short
            time of talking, I‚Äôve come to realize something, you're absolutely
            amazing
